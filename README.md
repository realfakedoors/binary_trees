# binary_trees
A couple exercises demonstrating the power of binary search trees.

Done as a project on Data Structures for The Odin Project:
https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/data-structures-and-algorithms

Binary Trees:
Build a simple binary tree data structure from some arbitrary input and also the “crawler” function that will locate data inside of it.

Knight's Travails:
build a function that shows the simplest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.
